🧮 Scientific Calculator (Java Swing)

A desktop Scientific Calculator built using Java and Swing in IntelliJ IDEA.
It supports both basic arithmetic operations and scientific functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, powers, and square roots — all in a simple graphical user interface.

🚀 Features

✅ Basic Operations

Addition (+)

Subtraction (−)

Multiplication (×)

Division (÷)

✅ Scientific Functions

Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), Tangent (tan)

Square root (√)

Power (x^y)

Logarithm base 10 (log)

Pi (π)

✅ Utility

Clear button (C) to reset all inputs

Handles decimal input (.)

Error handling for invalid inputs and divisions by zero

Results formatted to 8 decimal places for precision

🧰 Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Java 17+	Programming language
Swing (javax.swing)	GUI framework
AWT (java.awt)	Event handling & layout
IntelliJ IDEA	IDE for development
🖥️ How to Run the Project

Clone or Download the Project

git clone https://github.com/Khulekani-Nhlanhla/ScientificCalculator.git
cd ScientificCalculator


Open in IDE

Go to File → Open → Select the project folder

Make sure a JDK (17 or higher) is configured

Run the Application

Open ScientificCalculator.java

Run ScientificCalculator.java

The calculator window should appear

⚙️ How It Works

The GUI is built using Swing components:

JFrame → Main window

JTextField → Display screen

JButtons → Calculator buttons arranged in a GridLayout

Each button triggers an ActionListener that performs:

Parsing numeric input

Applying the chosen mathematical operation

Displaying the formatted result on the screen

🧠 Future Improvements

You can extend this project with:

Memory functions (M+, MR, MC)

Angle mode toggle (Degrees ↔ Radians)

Dark/light themes

Keyboard input support

Additional functions: factorial, exponential, modulus, etc.
